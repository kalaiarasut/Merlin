Collect samples during slack tide to minimize sediment suspension\n2. Use pre-filters (100μm) before main filtration (0.45μm)\n3. Reduce sample volume to 250-500mL when turbidity > 50 NTU\n4. Process samples within 1 hour due to rapid degradation\n5. Include salinity measurements with each sample\n\n**Tidal Considerations**:\n- Sample at both high and low tide for comprehensive species detection\n- Avoid sampling during strong tidal flows\n- Document tidal stage and current direction\n\n**Recommended Modifications**:\n- Use glass fiber pre-filters for high turbidity sites\n- Increase number of replicates (n=5 vs n=3)\n- Include tidal cycle in sampling design\n\n### Conclusions\nEstuarine eDNA studies require adapted protocols accounting for environmental variability. The modifications presented here improved detection rates by 35% compared to standard marine protocols."
